# Web-Based-QnA-tool
To build a web-based Q&A tool that meets your requirements, we can break down the implementation into several key components. Below is a step-by-step guide, including code snippets, to help you create this tool using Python, Streamlit, and relevant libraries.

Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
"pip install streamlit beautifulsoup4 requests sentence-transformers faiss-cpu"

Step 2: Create the Streamlit App
Create a new Python file, e.g., qa_tool.py, and start building the Streamlit app.

Step 3: Run the Streamlit App
To run your Streamlit app, use the following command in your terminal:

bash
streamlit run qa_tool.py

Step 4: Testing
Test the app by entering valid URLs and asking questions based on the content of those pages.
Ensure that the answers are derived solely from the ingested content.
